Hello!

I am a recent graduate - December 2019 - of Florida State University, where I earned a B.S in Statistics, and Economics, with my primary focus being in data analysis. While I search for my first full-time job, I've dedicated this page to showcasing past, and future data projects of mine.

So take a look around, and enjoy!
