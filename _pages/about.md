I'm a recent graduate of Florida State University where I earned a B.S. in Statistics, and Economics with my primary focus being in data analysis. While I search for my first full-time job, I've dedicated this page to sharing past, and future projects of mine.

My undergraduate curriculum focused heavily on SAS, so I am actively trying to broaden my skillset, currently focusing on improving with Python. I also have some self taught experience with MATLAB, MySQL, and R.

This is my first website, but as I learn more, she may eventually turn into something a little niftier. Who knows?



Though, for now, this'll do. Welcome!
