I'm a recent graduate of Florida State University where I earned a B.S. in Statistics, and Economics with my primary focus being in data analysis. While I search for my first full-time job, I've dedicated this page to sharing past, and future projects of mine.

This is my first website, but as I learn she may eventually develop into something a little niftier. Who knows?


But for now, this'll do. Welcome!
